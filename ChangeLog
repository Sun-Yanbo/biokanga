Release 2.76.7 Added support for reporting orphan PE reads as SE
Release 2.76.8 Fix for PE insert size distribution report - bug was introduced in 2.76.7
Release 2.80.0 Extended read alignment classifications and added target loci base constraint processing

Release 2.98.0 Limit of number of input files raised to 100 for SE and 200 (PE1 and PE2 each 100) files accepted. Rate of intermediate log progress writes reduced to 1 every 10 minutes (formerly was 1 every minute) and main thread stack size in sub-process 'scaffold' increased to 100MB
Release 2.98.8 Added additional subprocess for loading Blat generated PSL alignments into SQLite for ease of subsequent ad Hoc queries
Release 3.0.4  Added additional subprocess for reporting of Nxx length distributions
Release 3.0.9  de Novo assembly and scaffolding processing improvements
Release 3.1.0  Extends the mate pair end orientation support in the de Novo assembly and scaffolding subprocesses
Release 3.1.1  Iterative scaffolding with different mate pair libraries now supported
Release 3.3.5  BLAT/BLAST style DNA seeded local alignments now supported with the 'blitz' processing module
Release 3.3.8  Relaxed stringency of minimum overlap requirements in the assembly module
Release 3.4.0  Integrated loci remapping and reporting of regions of interest which are covered by reads
Release 3.4.2  Added vector contaminate processing to ngsqc and filter submodules
Release 3.4.3  Auto-switch to CSI indexes from SAI when aligning with BAM output format if any targeted sequence more than 512Mbp long
Release 3.4.5  Read lengths increased to 16Kbp, seed fastq up to 16Kbp accepted as seed contigs when assembling, default insert sizes for PE changed to be min 100bp and max 1000bp when aligning PE.
Release 3.4.18  Read lengths increased to 64Kbp, user can generate pseudorandom genome of up to 1Tbp and index same for benchmarking large memory host systems.
Release 3.5.1  Improved throughput during filtering and PE ends now treated as if SE during final assembly phases
Release 3.5.9  Bug fix for Phred score processing if enabled during the filter processing - post 3.4.x was effectively disabled
Release 3.6.0  Bug fix for NGSQC segfault under Ubuntu 14.04 when compiled optimised and Biokanga now under GIT version control
Release 3.7.6  Added chimeric read alignment capability and the ability to call di/tri-SNPs to the aligner.
