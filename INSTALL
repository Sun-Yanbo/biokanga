Version 4.3.4
===========================
Released March 1st 2017

INSTALL
=======
The 'biokanga' toolkit on Windows is compiled using Visual Studio 2015, or on Linux then
can be compiled using the standard GNU compiler toolchain.

Linux Basic Compilation
=======================

1: 'cd' into the top level directory containing the 'libbiokanga' and 'biokanga' source directories
2: From the shell prompt type the command `autoreconf -fi`
3: From the shell prompt type the command `sh ./configure` which will initialise Makefiles with system dependent build variable values
3: When './configure' has successfully completed then type the command 'make' which will compile and link the 'biokanga' toolkit
4: The 'biokanga' and 'pacbiokanga' executables will be created in their same named source directories from where they can be copied to a directory on the users $PATH
   Alternatively, 'make install' will compile/link 'biokanga' and 'pacbiokanga' and then copy the executables into the system dependent default path, e.g. '/usr/local/bin'
   Alternatively, you can override the default path with './configure --prefix=$HOME' or similar

Windows Visual Studio 2015 Compilation
======================================

1: In the top level directory source directories, double click on the 'biokanga.sln' icon
2: The default configuration is for Release x64, change as may be appropriate
3: Build the solution - this will compile the 'biokanga', 'pacbiokanga' source projects into the 'biokanga' and 'pacbiokanga' executables
4: By default, the generated 64bit executables will be copied into the directory Win64
