biokanga filter Filter NGS reads for sequencer errors and/or exact duplicates
Version 3.7.6
===========================
Released May 11th 2015

Use to filter reads for removal of reads containing sequencer induced
artefacts.

Filter Options:

-h, --help
	This option will display the list of options and brief help as to the
	function of each of these options together with default values, and
	then terminates the process

-v, --version, --ver
	This option displays the Biokanga build version and then
	terminates

-f, --FileLogLevel=<int>
	Use this option to control the level of diagnostics written to screen
	and logfile. Currently most log messages are written at the default
	level of diagnostics (3)

-F, --log=<file>
	Use to specify the log file to which diagnostics are to be written.
	If not specified then diagnostics will be written to screen only

-m, mode=<int>
	Processing mode:
		0 - filter reads into multifasta
		1 - filter reads into packed sequence file for subsequent
			de Novo assembly
		2 - load packed sequence file and output as multifasta

 -p, --minphred=<int>
       Only accept reads for filtering if their mean (over complete read
       sequence bases) Phred scores are at least this threshold (default 0
       to disable, range 15..40). Additionally, if any single base in the read
       sequence has a Phred score of less than 10 then that read is not
       accepted even if the mean Phred score is at least that requested.

-P, --iterativepasses=<int>
       Iterative passes repeating overlap processing (default 2, range 1..5)

-S, --strand
  	Strand specific filtering - filter reads with read orientation -
	default is for non-strand specific

-n, --indeterminates=<int>
  	Filter out input sequences having higher than this number of
	indeterminate bases (default is 0, range 0..5)

-x, --trim5=<int>
  	Trim this number of 5' bases from each input sequence (default is 0,
	range 0..20)

-X, --trim3=<int>
  	Trim this number of 3' bases from each input sequence (default is 0,
	range 0..20)

-l, --minlen=<int>
  	Filter out input sequences (after any trimming) which are less than
	this length (default is 50bp, range 20..5000)

-L, --trimseqlen=<int>
  	Trim sequences to be no longer than this length (default is 0 for no
	length trimming, MinSeqLen...1000)

-y, --minoverlap=<int>
  	Accept as overlapping if flank overlap is at least this many bases
	(defaults to 80% of mean sequence length, range 25bp..150bp). If set
	to -1 then overlap processing is disabled.

-D, --nodedupe
  	Do not dedupe exactly matching input sequences - default is to only
	retain a single copy of duplicate sequences

-d, --dedupepe
  	If paired end preprocessing then treat ends as independent when
	deduping

-c, --contaminants=<file>
	Optional multifasta file containing putative contaminant sequences
	(perhaps adaptor or primers) which may be overlapping onto the reads.
	If overlaps are detected then the overlapped reads will be
	appropriately trimmed to remove the contaminant sequence.

-i, --inpe1=<file>
  	Load single ended, or 5' if paired end, reads from fasta or fastq
	file(s); if single ended then wildcards allowed.
	Max of 100 files may be specified

-I, --inpe2=<file>
	Load 3' if paired end reads from fasta or fastq file(s)
	Max of 100 files may be specified

-o, --out=<file>
	Output multifasta ('-m0') or packed sequences ('-m1') to this file

-O, --dupdist=<file>
	Output duplicate distributions to this file

-T, --threads=<int>
	Number of processing threads 0..n (defaults to 0 which sets threads
	to number of CPU cores, max 64)

-q, --sumrslts=<file>
	Output results summary to this SQLite3 database file

-w, --experimentname=<str>
        Specifies experiment name to use in SQLite3 database file

-W, --experimentdescr=<str>
	Specifies experiment description to use in SQLite3 database file

Note: Options and associated parameters can be entered into an option parameter
file, one option and it's associated parameter per line.
To specify usage of this option paramter file to the BioKanga toolkit
components then precede it's name with '@', e.g. biokanga index @myparams.txt
